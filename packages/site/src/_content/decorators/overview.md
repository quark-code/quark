# Decorators

Decorators are functions that can be used to modify the behavior of classes, class methods and class fields. They are a stage 2 proposal for addition to the ECMAScript standard and have not been implemented by any browsers as yet, so you need to use a compiler like Babel or TypeScript. Lit provides a number of <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/components/decorators/" target="_blank">custom decorators</a> to simplify web component development with Lit and TypeScript, and Quark Core provides a couple more to fill in the gaps.

> These decorators are only of use if you're developing your own web components using Lit. You don't need them if you're just using the Quark Elements in an application.
