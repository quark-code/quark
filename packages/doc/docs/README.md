QuarkDoc is a very simple static site generator that was created for documenting the Quark Web Components, but can be used for pretty much anything. Each page template uses a layout template (master page) and optional includes (sub-pages) and is rendered as a separate HTML page. Data (dynamic content values) is managed separately and injected into page, layout and include templates. All templates are written as JavaScript modules using tagged template literals for creating the markup.
